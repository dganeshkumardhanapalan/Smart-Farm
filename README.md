## Smart Farm

## Abstract:

The greenhouse based modern agriculture industries are the recent requirement in every part of the world. In this technology, the humidity and 
temperature of plants are precisely controlled. Due to the variable atmospheric circumstances these conditions sometimes may vary from place to 
place in large farmhouse, which makes very difficult to maintain the uniformity at all the places in the farmhouse manually. It is observed that 
for the first time an android phone-control the Irrigation system, which could give the facilities of maintaining uniform environmental conditions 
are proposed. The Android Software Development Kit provides the tools and Application Programmable Interface necessary to begin developing 
applications on the Android platform using the Java programming language. Mobile phones have almost become an integral part of human life serving
multiple needs of humans. This application makes use of the GPRS [General Packet Radio Service] feature of mobile phone as a solution for 
irrigation control system. GSM (Global System for Mobile Communication) is used to inform the user about the exact field condition. The information 
is passed onto the user request in the form of SMS.


## Objective:

	Designing an embedded system which helps the farmer to supply water and control the gate valves
	To provide a simple and efficient irrigation application for the user to control the system
	To automatically power on or off the system in the low water level
	To keep track of moisture and humidity in the soil
	To acknowledge the user about the status of each control given to the system
	To reduce the Wastage of water and electricity 


## INFO:

The main emphasis is given to the android application that controls the functioning of irrigation in farm lands.
